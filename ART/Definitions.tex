\section{Distance}
We use the northing/easting approach to find the distance between two coordinates. This approach works best for not so long distances. $r_{e}$ represents the radius of the earth, the mean is 6371km. 


\[\delta = \sqrt((2r_{e}\pi\Delta_{ns})^2 + (2r_{e}\pi\Delta_{ew})^2) \cdot 1000\] 


\section{Time and Battery}
We assume that we get a set of values representing the battery and time consumption after traveling a meter. We find the standard deviation then using the distance formula we bound the expected battery usage. In this case $w$ represents a buffer value, is intended to be used as a range.

\[ \mu = \dfrac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{x_{i}}}{n} \]

\[ \sigma = \dfrac{\sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(x_{i} - \mu)^2}}{n} \]

\[ (\mu - \sigma - \dfrac{w}{2})\cdot\delta  < \mu\cdot\delta < (\mu+\sigma + \dfrac{w}{2} )\cdot\delta  \]
